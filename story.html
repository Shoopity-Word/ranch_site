      <p>John G. Dabney built a ring of rental cabins and a family home using logs he cut on nearby Black Mountain.
        Logs were hauled on a mule-drawn wagon across the creek to the building site. They were peeled and notched by hand.
        Working alone much of the time, he elected to construct the buildings stockade style placing the logs upright.
        He made benches, woodboxes, cupboards and tables for each cabin.</p>
      <p>Ruth died in 1937. John's second wife Mary became a favorite with guests. After John's death, caretakers helped manage the ranch and formed bonds with many of our visitors.
        John's family down to his great, great, great grandchildren continue to enjoy his legacy.</p>
      <p>Decendants of the first ranch guests return each year. Some who first came as small children have been enjoying our mountains for over 50 years. 
        We hope you will become a part of the  Continental Ranch family.</p>
